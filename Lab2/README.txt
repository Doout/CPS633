Main will run the program and prompt the user to go through what was asked from the project.

NOTE: In Main there is ACL and ACL2. ACL2 enables you to save the rights you save. However,
they are not reread each time the program starts. Instead the default values specified are 
used each time the program runs. That said, the saved user rights are saved each time they
are edited. So a change you make once is made ontop of older saves. 

Compile and run Main.java as you would for any java program.
